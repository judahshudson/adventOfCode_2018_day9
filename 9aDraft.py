ALGORITHM

Place Marbles
- 0 -> first marble at center

-placement: 
newIndex = between [currentIndex+1] and [currentIndex+2] ***use insertion***

-counting: 
wraps around (to zero and starts again)

-if multiple of 23: #special case
*currentPlayerScore += currentMarble 
(currentMarble not placed)
*currentPlayerScore += the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the current marble
{ [indexof(currentMarble)-7] }
*the marble 7 marbles counter-clockwise from the current marble is removed from the circle
{ removeMarble[indexof(currentMarble) - 7] }
*The marble immediately clockwise of the marble that was removed becomes the new current marble.
{ newCurrentMarble[indexof(removedMarbleAbove)-1] }

What Is The Winning Elf's Score?
-game ends after last marble is placed
-sort scores of all players
-return last/highest score

PSEUDO CODE
***CONTINUE HERE***
FIRST
-continue writing code
-create working program, NOT including 23 exception
-use printouts
*track progress
-run for input up to 22
*use sample code on website
*output should be same as printout diagram

-use functions


SECOND
-add 23 exception

-5 test cases listed on website
*function runTests
*use input, should match output
*unit testing,
*assertion, raise exception if fails, if true does nothing (use for debugging, not in production code)
*run first
*then ren rest of code

#handy starting functions templates:
(eg imports, read in file, functions)
def rangeInclusive(start, stop, step=1):
	return range(start, stop+step, step)

#google research "python generators"
def rangeInclusiveChars(start, stop):
	for i in rangeInclusive(ord(start), ord(stop)):
		yield char(i)


PART TWO / STAR 2
-if stuck:
	teachable moment with Jason
